            <p>We are creating social media 3.0 with influencers, celebrities and creators being able to launch
                their
                own digital currency by simply creating a profile with media content posted as Non fungible Tokens
                that
                can be owned and traded on the Tknrs network</p>

                    dependent on growing and engaging with the community and also their star power. They own
                    10-15% of the total value of the tokens minted.</p>

                    as
                    the ability to trade with other communities in order to gain access to more creator content with
                    early
                    token buyers being the biggest winners as the value of the token increases with more buyers. </p>

                <h3>We would only launch tokens with the express permission of the creators. </h3>
                <p>There are several thousand celebrities and creators on twitter, tiktok, Instagram and YouTube with
                    followings in the millions who we would be actively engaging before we go viral.</p>

                <p>We would get them on our
                    platform and they would see the opportunity to create a fan driven digital economy where their
                    digital
                    content can be traded as NFTs and their most loyal fans can have the monetary value of their
                    creator's
                    currency increase significantly as they promote their digital currency across their channels while
                    our
                    native token holders benefit from the Weentar popularity.</p>

            <p>Cryptocurrency adoption is at less than 1% of the global world population with some countries and
                entities actively fighting against its mass adoption and the smartest developers and nerds holding the
                fort.</p>

            <p>Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of tokens launched all aiming to fix one
                problem or the other with some quite simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal is to bring mass adoption to
                the cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far down? So down that even a celebrity can explain it
                in simple words to their followers and have them download an app, buy into the social currency of their
                favourite person and watch their
                investment as is with other crypto currency project. </p>
